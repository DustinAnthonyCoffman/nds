        <h3>MRSA DISINFECTION SERVICES</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>National Disinfection Services is the leading expert in the disinfection of MRSA. We provide emergency service 
        throughout the nation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
        
        <p>MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics. 
        In the general community, MRSA most often causes skin infections.In some cases, it causes pneumonia (lung infection) 
        and other issues.If left untreated, MRSA infections can become severe and cause sepsis-a life-threatening reaction to 
        severe infection in the body.</p>
        
        <p>Symptoms:</p>
        <ul>Most staph skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that might be:</ul>
            <li>Red</li>
            <li>Swollen</li>
            <li>Painful</li>
            <li>Warm to the touch</li>
            <li>Full of pus or other drainage•Accompanied by a fever</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transmission:</p>
        <p>
        Anyone can get MRSA on their body from contact with an infected wound or by sharing personal items, such as 
        towels or razors, that have touched infected skin. MRSA infection risk can be increased when a person is in 
        activities or places that involve crowding, skin-to-skin contact, and shared equipment or supplies. People 
        including athletes, daycare and school students, military personnel in barracks, and those who recently received 
        inpatient medical care are at higher risk.</p>
        
        <ul>Disinfection Methods:
            <li>Launder all clothing/bedding/towels with color safe bleach in hot water.</li>
            <li>Surface wipe all areas with Hospital Grade quaternary disinfectant (especially high contact areas).</li>
            <li>Electro Static Spray application of surface protector</li>
        </ul>
