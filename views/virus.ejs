        <p>
        A virus is a small infectious organism—much smaller than a fungus or bacterium—that must invade a living cell to 
        reproduce (replicate). The virus attaches to a cell (called the host cell), enters it, and releases its DNA or RNA 
        inside the cell. The virus’s DNA or RNA is the genetic material containing the information needed to make copies of 
        (replicate) the virus. The virus’s genetic material takes control of the cell and forces it to replicate the virus. 
        The infected cell usually dies because the virus keeps it from performing its normal functions. When it dies, the cell 
        releases new viruses, which go on to infect other cells.
