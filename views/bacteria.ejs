        <h3>BACTERIA DISINFECTION SERVICES</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>National Disinfection Services is the leading expert in the disinfection of bacteria. We provide emergency service 
        throughout National, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
        
        <p>Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms. There are thousands of different kinds, and they live in every 
        conceivable environment all over the world. They live in soil, seawater, and deep within the earth’s crust. Some 
        bacteria have been reported even to live in radioactive waste. Many bacteria live in the bodies of people and animals—on
        the skin and in the airways, mouth, and digestive, reproductive, and urinary tracts—without causing any harm. Such 
        bacteria are called resident flora, or the microbiome. Many resident flora are actually helpful to people—for example 
        by helping them digest food or by preventing the growth of other, more dangerous bacteria. Only a few kinds of bacteria 
        cause disease. They are called pathogens. Sometimes bacteria that normally reside harmlessly in the body cause disease. 
        Bacteria can cause disease by producing harmful substances (toxins), invading tissues, or doing both.</p>
